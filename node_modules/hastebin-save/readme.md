# hastebin-save
##### Hastebin-save is a module created by TheInteger with help of Games that can save text and files to hastebin, not only is it lightweight but also easy to use.

# How to use:
##### Let's say we want to upload the word "cow" to hastebin, we can do so by using the function "upload()". heres an example:
```js
const Hastebin = require("hastebin-save");
Hastebin.upload("cow", link => {
    console.log("https://hastebin.com/" + link)
});
```
##### But it would be different if we wanted to upload a file, so let's say you have this really cool javascript code you want to show everyone on your Discord server, but it is way too long to type into the Discord chat channel. We have the perfect solution for you, I'm going to show you how:
```js
const Hastebin = require("hastebin-save");
Hastebin.uploadFile("./mycooljavascriptcode.js", link => {
    console.log("https://hastebin.com/" + link)
});
```
##### Now you can just send the link to your buddies at discord! ;)
